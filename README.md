# Hey, my name is Liam ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

I currently work as a **Principal Systems Developer** for the digital agency **[IDHL](https://www.idhlagency.com)**.

I specialise in web development, primarily using **.NET** technologies. My main focus is building dynamic and engaging websites using platforms such as [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com) and [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/).

Oh, and for being passionate about their platform and helping others, Kentico have awarded me with Kentico MVP status. Let's take a look at a nice badge ðŸ‘€
