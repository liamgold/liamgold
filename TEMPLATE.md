### Hello, my name is [Liam Goldfinch](https://www.goldfinch.me/). ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a Principal Systems Developer for the digital web agency [NetConstruct](https://www.netconstruct.com/).

I have been honoured with the [Kentico MVP](https://www.kentico.com/partners/mvp-program) award consecutively since 2022, acknowledging my passion for their DXP offering and the substantial assistance I have provided to members of the community.
